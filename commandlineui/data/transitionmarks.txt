1081210016	transition is succession of moving from one state to the other. this means that in automata theory, the arrow will point to the other state as transition occurs. 	2
1081210019	Transition means transformation from one state to another state i.e. moving from one state to a different state 	2
1081210020	Transition is the phenomenon of shifting from one state to another in the workflow. 	2
1081210040	Transition is represented by a solid arrow which goes from one state to another. this is also labeled by some conditions that are responsible for the state transition 	2
