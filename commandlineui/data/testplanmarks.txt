1081210003	test plan is necessary because testing of a software from time to time is the most important aspect of developing a softwatare. if there will not be proper test plan , then the developers will keep developing the software with errors , which when detected at some later time will be very much tedious to correct..therefore , even before start developing the software , a proper test plan must be developed	2
1081210004	Test plan is used to draw out a plan about how the process of testing will be done. It is very important as road map for testing activities, random tseting would lead to whether usability, user confusion and less efficiency.	2
1081210080	Test plan is necessary because it helps out in finding the errors or bugs in a system and helps in removal of the bug. Continuos testing helps in creating an error free system. As a system is tested again and again for the bugs errors are likely to get removed. 	2
1081210016	a test paln is necessary since it should be maintained that all the parts of the software are equally tested and the testing is not concentrated to only certain parts, since testing without a plan will make it liable to do so. 	1.5
1081210040	Test plan is used to check if the requirements are fullfiled or not. The testing process includes various testing methods such as white box testing, black box testing, etc. All the errors are found in the testing phase. After the errors are detected they are debugged. 	1.5
1081210043	Test plan is necessary to figure out whether the software is working according to its need or not.A good test plan ensures that the ntesting is done in an efficient manner and not a lot of t8ime,money,people and resources are wasted. Also the software obtained turns out better after a good test 	1.5
1081210048	TEST PLAN IS NECCESSARY TO CHECK FOR THE PROBLEMS OR ERRORS, ALSO A SOFTWARE SHOULD BE TESTED FOR ALL SPECIFICATIONS , COMPATIBILTY BEFORE HANDING OBER TO THE USER 	1.5
1081210007	It is used for proper testing of the system and to find errors that are not yet discovered. 	1
1081210015	A test plan ensures that any errors found are identified and removed. 	1
1081210020	A test plan can help ensure that any errors found are identified and eliminated at the earliest. Increases efficiency of the design process. 	1
1081210037	A test plan can help ensure that any errors found are identified and eliminated at the earliest. 	1

1081210065	The necessiity of a test plan is very important as it helps in testing the product or the prototype prior to its final execution. 	1
